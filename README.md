git clone https://github.com/pactools/pactools.git
cd pactools
make develop
```

## Update

git pull origin master
make in

## Dependencies

The code is not fully tested. It is supposed to be working with:

```
Python >= 3.5
NumPy >= 1.10
SciPy >= 0.17
Matplotlib >= 1.5
MNE-Python >= 0.11
PYTEST >= 3.0 (optional, used for testing)
```

It might work with previous versions also, yet nothing is guaranteed.
