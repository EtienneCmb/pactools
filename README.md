git clone https://github.com/TomDLT/pactools.git
cd pactools
make develop

## Update

git pull origin master
make in

## Dependencies

The code is actually NOT tested. It is supposed to be working with:

```
Python >= 3.5
NumPy >= 1.10
SciPy >= 0.17
Matplotlib >= 1.5
MNE-Python >= 0.11 (optional)
NEO >= 0.3 (optional)
PYTEST >= 3.0 (optional, for testing)
```

It might work with previous versions also, yet nothing is guaranteed.
